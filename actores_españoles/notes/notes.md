# Web Scraping Spanish Actors on IMDB

## Project Description
This project involves web scraping the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) to gather information about Spanish actors. The aim is to collect relevant data such as names, filmographies, movie ratings, birthdates, and more, for analysis and research purposes.

## Tools and Technologies
- Programming Language: Python
- Data Management: Pandas for handling and storing the collected data.
- Web Scraping Libraries:</br>
 · from IPython.core.display import HTML</br>
 · from bs4 import BeautifulSoup</br>
 · import requests

## Methodology
The web scraping process is carried out in the following steps:
- URL Identification: Locate specific IMDB pages listing Spanish actors. We use "https://www.imdb.com/search/name/?birth_place=Spain&adult=include&count=100&start=1&ref_=rlm"
- Data Extraction: Use Beautiful Soup and Requests to extract the desired information from these pages.
- Data Processing: Clean and structure the extracted data for ease of handling and analysis.
- Data Storage: Save the data in a structured format like CSV or a database for subsequent analysis.

## Considerations
- Ethical and Legal Aspects
- Compliance with IMDB's Terms of Service: Ensure that the scraping activities adhere to the terms and conditions of IMDB to avoid any legal issues.
- Respect for Privacy: Be cautious about collecting personal data and respect privacy norms. Avoid scraping sensitive information.

## Technical Considerations
- Rate Limiting: Implement measures to avoid sending too many requests in a short period, which could lead to IP blocking or other access issues with IMDB.
- Error Handling: Develop robust error handling to manage potential issues such as connection timeouts or changes in the website's layout.
